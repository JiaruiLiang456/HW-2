But when you find yourself frustrated with a ChatBots inability to give you the results you're looking for, this is a \"hint\" that you've become overreliant on the ChatBots. Your objective should not be to have ChatBots \"do the work for you\", but to use ChatBots to help you build your understanding so you can efficiently leverage ChatBots (and other resources) to help you work more efficiently.<br><br>\n",

The contestant is then given a chance to switch their door choice. The simulation tests whether switching doors increases the chances of winning.\n",

In addition, I need to learn how to make models to represent companies's data like earing, asscss risks and make investment recommendations. To train skills I mention before, I need to go to the class of stastics and computer science to learn the basic skills of coding and data analysis. In addition, I also need to go to the financial and economic class to learn skills of evlation of financial risks."
